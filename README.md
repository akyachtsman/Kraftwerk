Our goal of this project was to identify the conditions where drivers were most likely to accept the coupons presented to them while driving around town. We can confidently conclude that the customers who were most likely to accept the coupons are ones from Coffee houses and cheap restaurants. Based on the data, a far majority of the acceptance occurred in the OPPOSITE direction that they were driving. When drivers did not have children in the car, they were more likely to accept coupons. The majority of drivers that accepted bar coupons were between 21 to 26 years or over 50. Weather had a minor effect on coupon acceptance with a slightly better acceptance rate in warmer temperatures. Finally, when the distance to the coupon destination was less than 15 minutes, acceptance rates were high (78%), when less then 25 minutes, acceptance was 56% and over 25 minutes, the acceptance rate was a mere 12%!
Please refer to the link https://github.com/akyachtsman/Kraftwerk/blob/main/my.coupon.analysis.ipynb to show how we arrived at the above conclusions. Please note that of the graphs, esp. the plotly graph in our jupyter notebook are not displayed as is in the respository since they are running on java and must be downloaded and executed to be fully realized.
